## About

This is the official Wails React-TS template.

You can configure the project by editing `wails.json`. More information about the project settings can be found
here: <https://wails.io/docs/reference/project-config>

## Live Development

To run in live development mode, run `wails dev` in the project directory. This will run a Vite development
server that will provide very fast hot reload of your frontend changes. If you want to develop in a browser
and have access to your Go methods, there is also a dev server that runs on <http://localhost:34115>. Connect
to this in your browser, and you can call your Go code from devtools.

## Building

To build a redistributable, production mode package, use `wails build`.

### Front end

The frontend is using shadcn ui components library <https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/components>

To add new ui components

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add button
```
